        '<p>Hi there, <strong>welcome to Paperwork</strong>, the open source note-taking solution. This
        is your first note and we&#39;d like to explain to you some features we hope you&#39;ll find very
        interesting.</p><h3><strong>Notes</strong></h3><p>Notes are the basic form of writing in Paperwork.
        Notes are saved inside notebooks. You already have one named &#39;Welcome&#39; in which this note is
        stored. You can create as much notebooks and notes as you want by using the <a id="file_click_handler" href="#">
        File menu</a>.</p><h3><strong>Attachments</strong></h3><p>You can also add attachments to your notes.
        This allows you to embed important information and have it there when you need it. Just click its link,
        and you&#39;ll be sent to the file. And since Paperwork is self hosted, you have better privacy too.</p>
        <h3><strong>Tags</strong></h3><p>Tags are one of Paperwork&#39;s powerful features. Tags allow you to search
        for related notes but which are not in the same notebook. Do you have an idea and want to save it for later now?
        Put it in a notebook (like &#39;dinner cooking&#39;) and tag it with cooking. Later, when you&#39;ve got time you
        can just click on cooking from the sidebar and all cooking-related notes are there, no matter if they&#39;re for lunch,
        dinner or breakfast.</p><h3><strong>Search</strong></h3><p>If you want to search with a more detailed criteria, you can
        use Paperwork&#39;s search feature. Just <a id="search_handler" href="#">write your query</a> and Paperwork will show you the results from
        all your notes, no matter in which notebook they are or tag they have.</p><h3><strong>Version Control</strong></h3><p>Everytime
        you save a note in Paperwork, a new version is created. This feature allows you to be able to see what changed throughout the
        life of your note in a detailed manner.</p><h3><strong>Shareable</strong></h3><p>Each note you write on Paperwork can be shared
        with any other user of Paperwork. Are you a company employee and would like to share those draft guidelines for that project? No
        worries, just sare the note with those users you want to share it with while keeping total control of your note. You can control
        who sees and edits the note and you can also who did what thanks to version control.</p><p>We hope that you like your experience
        with Paperwork. If you have any feedback or encounter any issues, just submit an issue <a href="https://github.com/twostairs/paperwork/issues/new">
        on Github</a>. If you want to be informed on what we&#39;re planning for Paperwork and be able to participate in the discussion, please join
        our mailing list <a href="mailto:paperwork-dev@googlegroups.com">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Thanks for choosing Paperwork,</strong></p><p><strong>
        The Paperwork Team. </strong></p>',
